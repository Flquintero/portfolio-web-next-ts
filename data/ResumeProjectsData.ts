If I see a problem out in the world I want to solve I will build something with a technology I want to try out.
Projects have been built using Javascript Frameworks such as Next, React, Vue and Nuxt. Since 2020 I have been doing all with TypeScript. You can learn more about them in my Github profile.`;
