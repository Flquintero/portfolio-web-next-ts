  the business side of a startup. Wearing many hats as a founder I learned almost every aspect of product development to the point that I become a software engineer.
  Throughout my career I have been able to me expand on my cross functional
  experience and become more knowleable in agile methodologies as well as the intricacies of managing teams. But more importantly, in each role, I have been able to deepen my knowledge of
  building complex applications with Javascript frameworks.`;
