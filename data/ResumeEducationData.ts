export const educationText = `My educational background was always geared towards business and law. I always saw myself going into International Relations or Diplomacy. It wasn’t until a friend's phone call in 2011 that my career shifted abruptly into Technology and I never looked back. All my education has helped me along the way and I’m grateful for everything I was able to learn and the life experiences in the different cities where I studied.`;
